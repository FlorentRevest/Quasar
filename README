First of all, you must check that you have a simple working compilation chain including: gcc, nasm and ld
In order to compile and install Quasar on a disk image you just have to type:
    $ make

And to test Quasar with QEMU, type:
    $ make runqemu

If you have troubles compiling stage2, you'll probably need the following additional tools :
	* Grub2
	* xorriso (used to generate the disk image)
